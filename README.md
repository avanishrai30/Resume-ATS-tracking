# Resume-ATS-tracking
This repository contains a Streamlit application for an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that improves resumes. It uses the Google Generative AI (Gemini) API to evaluate resumes based on job descriptions. The application extracts text from PDF resumes using PyPDF2 and analyzes it against the job description provided by the user.
